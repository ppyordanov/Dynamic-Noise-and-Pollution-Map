                    It is important that both students and staff are aware of the air quality and levels of noise around the university campus in order to allow them to know where the most appropriate places to walk and study are. Building a dynamic map of the campus that can aggregate information about air pollution (in PPM,  parts per million) and noise (decibels) while at the same time educating users what the normal values for these variables (noise and NO2, CO, the main air pollutants) are is a good solution to this task.
                    The features that the startup kit provides make it a very suitable product for this project&#39;s needs.

                    <br><br>It has been used as a portable probing device paired with a mobile device&#39;s GPS sensor in order to generate a dynamic campus map that is flexible and intuitive to use. One of the possible use cases is suggesting quiet and clean air routes to end users. The final project deliverable is a mobile application and a backend infrastructure.

                    <br><br>The project makes use of the client-server software engineering paradigm allowing system users to consult the application whenever they need environmental data information and also improve it by participating in the data collection process (provided they have access to a Smart Citizen Kit).

                    <br><br>The software system has been evaluated by recruiting volunteer participants to collect environmental data and test the mobile web application.
