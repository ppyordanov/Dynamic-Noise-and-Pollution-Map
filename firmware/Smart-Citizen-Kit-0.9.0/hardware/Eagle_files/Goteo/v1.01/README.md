Smart Citizen Kit BETA version
- Base Board v1.01
- Ambient Sensor Board v1.0

The SCK is a piece of hardware comprised by two printed-circuit boards: an interchangeable daughterboard or shield, and an arduino-compatible data- processing board. 
The sensor board carries sensors that measure air composition (CO and NO2), temperature, light intensity, sound levels, and humidity. Once it’s set up, the ambient board is able to stream data measured by the sensors over Wi-Fi using the FCC-certified, wireless module on the data-processing board.

CHANGES:

Base Board v1.01
Some improvements:

- Wifly 3V3 RIN connected to GND
- Adding new diode for the battery of RTC
